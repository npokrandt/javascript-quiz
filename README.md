# JavaScript Quiz

## How to use this site

Welcome to my JavaScript quiz! Upon reaching the page you will be presented with the instructions and a link to the high score page. You can go there but initially there will be no high scores to see! Click the 'Start Quiz' button to start the quiz. You will be presented with ten questions on various JS knowledge, and 90 seconds to answer them. Incorrect answers deduct five seconds from the timer. If the timer reaches 0 you lose and no high score will be recorded. If you finish with time on the clock, the seconds remaining is your score. You will be prompted for initials, which will be saved with your score. From there you can retake the quiz as many times as you want! The high score page has the option to clear high scores, and you will be prompted to confirm that action.
